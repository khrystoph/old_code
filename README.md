# Old Code
This is a collection (folderized) of code projects I have found from back when I was in high school or college that I managed to save over the years 

1. Datastructures and Algorithms abet Lab
  * This was the project I had to write for my Data Structures and algorithms class for our school to comply with abet accreditation. It explores sorting and inserting algorithms for arrays and does a performance analysis of each method.
1. Datastructures and Algorithms Lab3
  * I honestly don't remember what this lab was about or if I actually finished it. I know it did something with sorting algorithms, but I think it only explored heapsort and allowed injection of network IDs and changing the priority of a subnet, which will change it's order in the array.
